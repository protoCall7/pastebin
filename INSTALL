The installation is very simple and only requires a few steps.

1) $ perl Makefile.PL

This will generate a makefile.  Pay attention to it's output, as it will inform
you of any missing module dependancies.  Modules can be installed as follows:

$ sudo cpan -i <module::name>

Once all module dependencies have been met:

2) $ make
3) $ make test
4) $ sudo make install
